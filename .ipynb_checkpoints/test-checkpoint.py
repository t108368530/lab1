This script provides an implementation of pitch shifting using the "time-domain pitch synchronous
overlap and add (TD-PSOLA)" algorithm. The original PSOLA algorithm was introduced in [1].

Description
The main script td_psola.py takes raw audio as input and applies steps similar to those described in [2].
First, it locates the time-domain peaks using auto-correlation. It then shifts windows centered at the
peaks closer or further apart in time to change the periodicity of the signal, which shifts the pitch
without affecting the formant. It applies linear cross-fading as introduced in [3] and implemented in
[4], the algorithm used for Audacity's simple pitch shifter.

Notes:
- Some parameters in the program related to frequency are hardcoded for singing voice. They can be
    adjusted for other usages.
- The program is designed to process sounds whose pitch does not vary too much, as this could result
    in glitches in peak detection (e.g., octave errors). Processing audio in short segment (e.g.,
    notes or words) is recommended. Another option would be to use a more robust peak detection
    algorithm, for example, pYIN [5]
- Small pitch shifts (e.g., up to 700 cents) should not produce many artifacts. Sound quality degrades
    if the shift is too large.
- The signal is expected to be voiced. Unexpected results may occur in the case of unvoiced signals
